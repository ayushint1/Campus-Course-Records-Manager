🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java SE 8+

IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code

Libraries: Java Collections, Streams, NIO.2, Date & Time API

📖 Documentation (Required Sections)
1. Evolution of Java

Java 1995 (initial release by Sun Microsystems) → Java 8 (2014, Streams & Lambdas) → Java 17 (LTS).

From applets → enterprise → cloud-native development.

2. Java ME vs SE vs EE

Java ME: Mobile & embedded devices.

Java SE: Core Java, standard applications (this project uses SE).

Java EE: Enterprise apps, web servers, distributed systems.

3. Java Architecture

JDK → Tools + JRE.

JRE → Libraries + JVM.

JVM → Runs bytecode across platforms (WORA).

4. Installation Guide

Install JDK (Oracle/OpenJDK).

Add JAVA_HOME and update PATH.

Verify with:

java -version
javac -version

5. Eclipse Setup

Download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.

Create new Java project → link to this repo.

Add packages under edu.ccrm.*.

Run Main.java.

(Add screenshots of setup in /screenshots)

▶️ How to Run
cd src
javac Main.java
java Main

📸 Screenshots & Recordings

Place program run screenshots in /screenshots.

Place demo recordings (optional) in /recordings.
